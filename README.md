# USRP-Verification
Contains script that verifies whether your USRP has been function properly.

## Why this is needed
Our lab has multiple broken USRPs, this repo's aim is to identify whether any one of them can still properly transmit and receive. Both Tx and Rx functionality needs to be tested since some of our USRPs have broken receivers but a functional transmitters, while some others have broken Txs but functional Rxs.

## Important Note
`.sh` file is used only to store the command. Do not run it directly.

## TODO
Add supprt for USRP N310 and maybe others.
